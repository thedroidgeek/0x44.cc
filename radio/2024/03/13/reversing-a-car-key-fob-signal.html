          <p>
            I’ve had the curiosity to explore radio communication protocols for
            a few years now, ever since I’ve started fiddling around with an
            RTL-SDR dongle. I always had the goal of figuring out how data is
            transmitted in remote controls (car key fobs particularly), trying
            replay attacks, and other possible attack vectors.
          </p>

          <p>
            Despite capturing some car key fob signals over the years, I haven’t
            had the chance of doing meaningful analysis on them, and that’s
            mainly due to the limited access I had to cars I could test on.
          </p>

          <p>
            This blog post aims to bring the uninitiated through my journey of
            having successfully reverse engineered and replayed a car’s key fob
            signal last year, starting from the very basic concepts of radio
            frequency and going all the way through my entire thought process
            while I was working on this project.
          </p>

          <p>
            Another goal I guess is to also prove that most cars are definitely
            not that easy to steal using replay attacks (unless it’s a

            claiming the risk warrants the ban of a device made of very cheap
            and accessible wireless modules.

          <p>
            I’ve had my first dive into the world of radio frequency back in
            2016 when I learned that a very cheap (~$10) terrestrial TV/radio
            USB dongle can easily be turned into a multi-purpose RF receiver to
            inspect and decode pretty much anything happening in the range of 24
            to 1750 MHz - this device is widely known as ‘RTL-SDR’:
          </p>

          <p><img src="https://i.0x44.cc/b/rtl-sdr.png" alt="" /></p>

          <p>
            The secret why this cheap device is very powerful, is the simple
            fact that it uses a chip which allows the use of
            <a
              href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Software-defined_radio"
              rel="noopener noreferrer"
              target="_blank"
              >SDR (software defined radio)</a
            >. It turns out that this chip (RTL2832U) allowed skipping the
            signal processing that usually happens on the hardware-level which
            converts the raw signal into ‘meaningful’ data to be used by the
            host device (a TV/radio feed in the case of this device).
          </p>

          <p>
            By having direct access to the raw I/Q data, we can receive,
            visualize and save pretty much any signal in raw format, without
            needing to know the specifics of the RF configuration used to
            transmit (modulation, bandwidth, data rate, etc.), since we can
            analyze/process the raw data ourselves. This effectively gives us a
            window to scan for virtually any activity on the radio spectrum
            under the 1.7 GHz frequency.
          </p>

          <h4 id="flipper-zero">Flipper Zero</h4>

          <p>
            The Flipper Zero is an electronic gadget which attracted a lot of
            attention lately for being a hacker/troll’s ultimate Swiss knife,
            since it hosts a bunch of wireless hardware modules that allow
            ‘interacting with’ everyday electronics and consumer appliances.
          </p>

          <p><img src="https://i.0x44.cc/b/flipper-zero.jpg" alt="" /></p>

          <p>
            The module that’s interesting to us in the Flipper is the Sub-GHz
            one, which is essentially a
            <a
              href="https://www.ti.com/product/CC1101"
              rel="noopener noreferrer"
              target="_blank"
              >CC1101</a
            >
            chip that supports frequencies that are typically used in wireless
            consumer devices, and that are under 1 GHz, hence the name of the
            module.
          </p>

          <p>
            It’s important to note, however, that one could just buy the CC1101
            module separately ($5+) and make it work with an Arduino/Raspberry
            Pi or simply a USB-to-TTL adapter, but the Flipper is definitely
            cooler and more practical. ¯\_(ツ)_/¯
          </p>

          <h4 id="cc1101-vs-rtl2832u">CC1101 vs RTL2832U</h4>

          <p>
            The CC1101 chip in the Flipper Zero, unlike the RTL2832U chip that’s
            on the RTL-SDR, is actually a transceiver module (supports sending
            and receiving), which means the Flipper Zero is the device we’ll be
            using to send signals.
          </p>

          <p>
            However, the CC1101 chip doesn’t support SDR, which means that it
            would only send back data that it had completely processed. In other
            terms, the CC1101 will only be useful to us if we set the right RF
            configuration of the transmitted signal.

            Radio frequency signal basics (<em>oversimplified</em>)
          </h3>

          <p>
            Now that we know a bit about the hardware we’ll be using, let’s go
            through some minimum basic concepts that are needed to tackle this
            subject.
          </p>

          <h4 id="intro">Intro</h4>

          <p>
            Radio frequency transmissions use radio waves, which are a type of
            electromagnetic radiation, in order to send signals.
          </p>

          <p>
            These waves are of a typically higher frequency than the original
            signal we’re transmitting and this is to ensure reliability in
            sending data, since signals can have varying characteristics that
            make sending them as radio waves impractical and susceptible to
            interference and weak travel distance.
          </p>

          <p>
            These waves are called carrier waves, since they are essentially
            modified to carry the original signal reliably through the air (more
            on this below).
          </p>

          <p>
            Let’s take a look at <em>some</em> of the basic information needed
            to send/receive a radio signal:
          </p>

          <h4 id="frequency">Frequency</h4>

          <p>
            This one is self-explanatory, it’s the number of times a second a
            carrier wave occurs. Frequency affects the wavelength (the higher
            the frequency the shorter the waves). This parameter is also
            typically used to define the communication channel.
          </p>

          <h4 id="modulation">Modulation</h4>

          <p>
            This refers to the way a signal is represented in the radio waves.
            The two most common modulation types, which I’m sure most people
            already know of, are:
          </p>

          <p>
            <strong>AM</strong> (<em>amplitude</em> modulation) and
            <strong>FM</strong> (<em>frequency</em> modulation).
          </p>

          <p>
            The difference between these is simply the fact that for AM, the
            signal is modulated (encoded) in <em>amplitude</em> (or strength),
            which roughly means that the <em>change</em> in signal
            <em>strength</em> on the carrier waves is how the data is
            represented.
          </p>

          <p>
            For FM, as one can guess, the data is rather modulated in
            <em>frequency</em>. So, changes in the frequency of the waves are
            used here to determine the data.
          </p>

          <p>
            This is well visualized in this animation I found on Wikipedia (the
            ‘signal’ graph represents the data we’re trying to transmit):
          </p>

          <p>
            <img src="https://i.0x44.cc/b/radio-fm-vs-am-anim.gif" alt="" />
          </p>

          <p>
            Modulations can also have different subtypes and characteristics
            which we’ll talk about later on.
          </p>

          <h4 id="bandwidth">Bandwidth</h4>

          <p>
            This refers to the range of frequencies occupied by a modulated RF
            signal, or in other words, the difference between the highest and
            the lowest frequency a modulated signal can have. This essentially
            dictates the amount of data a signal can carry.
          </p>

          <p>
            Since the rest of the radio characteristics are not terribly
            important for us to know at this stage, let’s move on to the fun
            stuff!
          </p>

          <h3 id="visual-analysis">Visual analysis</h3>

          <h4 id="sdr">SDR#</h4>

          <p>
            <a
              href="https://airspy.com/download/"
              rel="noopener noreferrer"
              target="_blank"
              >SDR#</a
            >
            is a free, intuitive, computer-based DSP (Digital Signal Processing)
            application for SDR written in C# with a focus on performance. It
            allows visualizing the radio spectrum in real time, and supports the
            demodulation of some common modulations. It also supports
            third-party plugins for custom modulations and integrations.
          </p>

          <p>
            We’ll be using this software for our signal discovery and initial
            analysis phase.
          </p>

          <h4 id="signal-discovery">Signal discovery</h4>

          <p>
            By tuning into the 433.92 MHz frequency with our RTL-SDR dongle
            plugged in (using the WinUSB driver instead of the stock DVB-T one),
            we can watch the activity of most remote controls in close proximity
            (433.92 MHz being the standard unregulated frequency in the EU and
            other neighboring countries, including Morocco, where I live).
          </p>

          <p>
            On each car key fob button press we instantly notice that there’s 3
            successive short bursts generated, as can be seen on the waterfall
            view under the spectrum visualizer:
          </p>

          <p>
            <img src="https://i.0x44.cc/b/sdrsharp-key-fob-433.png" alt="" />
          </p>

          <p>
            <small style="display: block; text-align: center"
              >SDR# visualizing the key fob signal (X axis = frequency, Y axis =
              signal intensity)</small
            >
          </p>

          <p>
            We can also notice that the signal has two major ‘peaks’ on both
            sides of the 433.92 MHz frequency (the red line in the middle is the
            exact tuning frequency).
          </p>

          <p>
            Doing some research on common modulation schemes, we come across
            2-FSK that sounds interesting:
          </p>

          <h4 id="2-fsk">2-FSK</h4>

          <p>
            FSK stands for Frequency-Shift Keying, which is a frequency
            modulation scheme in which data is encoded on a carrier signal by
            periodically shifting the frequency of the carrier between several
            discrete frequencies.
          </p>

          <p>
            Pretty straightforward so far, sounds like we’re dealing with FM
            here.
          </p>

          <p>
            The interesting part is the ‘2’ however, which here stands for the
            number of channels used in the encoding. So, we’re actually encoding
            binary data in two separate frequencies here, one for the
            <strong>0</strong> and the other for the <strong>1</strong>, which
            would explain the two peaks we’re noticing.
          </p>

          <p>
            <strong><em>Note:</em></strong> One might wonder what the other
            smaller ‘peaks’ are in that screen capture - those are basically
            unwanted frequencies that are generated accidentally by the emitter
            chip, due to the cheap nature of the hardware, and due to the very
            close proximity of the remote and the antenna. So, it’s just a bunch
            of ‘noise’ that we can safely ignore.
          </p>

          <h3 id="practical-analysis">Practical analysis</h3>

          <p>
            Now that we checked what the signal looks like visually, let’s
            explore how we can work on analyzing it in order to read the bits
            from the RF waves in hopes to spot some sort of
            structure/consistency.
          </p>

            As the README of its repository states, the
            <a
              href="https://github.com/jopohl/urh"

              >Universal Radio Hacker (URH)</a
            >
            is a complete open-source suite for wireless protocol investigation
            with native support for many common SDRs. URH allows easy
            demodulation of signals combined with an automatic detection of
            modulation parameters making it a breeze to identify the bits and
            bytes that fly over the air.
          </p>

          <p>
            This is precisely the software we need to decode radio waves into
            bits.
          </p>

          <p>
            As we open URH, we’re invited to either open a file or record
            directly from a device.
          </p>

          <p>
            Before recording, we have to select the source device, and set some
            basic radio parameters (I actually only made sure to put the right
            frequency and left everything else as default):
          </p>

          <p>
            <img
              src="https://i.0x44.cc/b/urh-record-dialog-rtlsdr.png"
              alt=""
            />
          </p>

          <p>
            After recording a signal, URH will try to autodetect the right
            configuration to use when decoding the radio waves.
          </p>

          <p>
            On my initial recordings, I wasn’t able to get URH to find the right
            parameters for me, which gave me wrong results. I have however later
            figured out that recording multiple repetitive signals in one go
            increases the chance that URH will figure out the right
            configuration, which turned out to be in my case: 50 samples/symbol,
            FSK.
          </p>

          <p>
            <img
              src="https://i.0x44.cc/b/urh-signal-interpretation.png"
              alt=""
            />
          </p>

          <p>
            Zooming in on one of the signals, we notice the 3 bursts we
            identified on SDR# (the second of which is made of 3 separate ones -
            so we have 5 sections to analyze now):
          </p>

          <p><img src="https://i.0x44.cc/b/urh-signal-zoom-in.png" alt="" /></p>

          <p>
            For each of these sections, a bit sequence is automatically
            extracted, which we can also convert to hex for a better
            visualization:
          </p>

          <p>
            <img src="https://i.0x44.cc/b/urh-signal-zoom-in-hex.png" alt="" />
          </p>

          <p>
            We can already notice a lot of consistency and repeating patterns in
            the bytes, which is a sign that we’re on the right path.
          </p>

          <p>
            However, to my eyes, we’re still missing something here, because we
            notice the same 5 hex digits being repeated, with a lot of 0x55
            bytes (01010101) also, which is pretty intriguing.
          </p>

          <p>
            Going over to the next tab labeled ‘Analysis’, we can see the bytes
            we’ve just extracted from each burst, each represented in a line,
            and there’s a decoding option that shows up with a bunch of curious
            algorithms:
          </p>

          <p>
            <img

              alt=""
            />
          </p>

          <p>
            By brute forcing my way and trying them consecutively, I noticed
            that one of them (Manchester II) converted all the 0x55 bytes to
            null ones, and without producing any decoding errors:
          </p>

          </p>

          <p>These bytes look more legit now.</p>

              >Manchester</a
            >
            is a very simple digital modulation scheme that ensures that the
            signal never remains at logic low or logic high for an extended
            period of time, and also converts the data signal into a
            data-plus-synchronization signal (for
            <a

          <p>
            These characteristics are very useful when sending digital data over
            analog mediums that tend to be susceptible to noise and

          <p>
            In Manchester, binary data is encoded in two opposite bits,
            therefore:
          </p>

          <p>
            <strong>0</strong> becomes <strong>01</strong> and
            <strong>1</strong> becomes <strong>10</strong> (or the other way
            around, depending on the convention):
          </p>

          </p>

          <p>Let’s go back and continue our investigation.</p>

          <p>
            By doing some manual examination and comparison of the different
            captures, we’re able to note that each button press generates a
            signal with the following characteristics:
          </p>

          <ol>
            <li>
              A <span style="color: yellow">long burst</span> with no data
              (decodes to 100 null bytes).
            </li>
            <li>
              3 bursts which look very similar with only 2 bytes partially
              <span style="color: red">changing</span>.
            </li>
            <li>
              A <span style="color: lightgreen">final burst</span> which is
              shorter but still looks fairly similar to the previous 3 bursts.
            </li>
          </ol>

          <p>
            <img
              src="https://i.0x44.cc/b/urh-initial-signal-structure-highlight.png"
              alt=""
            />
          </p>

          <p>
            I decided to look more closely at the 3 bursts (let’s call them
            packets) in the middle since they seem to be the important part of
            the signal, and I was quickly able to spot what seems to be an
            <span style="color: deepskyblue">incremental ID</span> which
            increases by 1 on each new signal:
          </p>

          <p>
            <img
              src="https://i.0x44.cc/b/urh-incremental-id-spotted.png"
              alt=""
            />
          </p>

          <p>
            To be able to move forward with our analysis, we must learn about a
            very important remote control security mechanism:
          </p>

          <h4 id="rolling-codes">Rolling codes</h4>

          <p>
            A rolling code is used in keyless entry systems to prevent a simple
            form of replay attack, where an eavesdropper records the
            transmission and replays it at a later time to cause the receiver to
            ‘unlock’. Such systems are typical in garage door openers and
            keyless car entry systems. More on
            <a
              href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rolling_code"
              rel="noopener noreferrer"
              target="_blank"
              >Wikipedia</a
            >.
          </p>

          <p>
            The gist of this system is that the key and the car both ‘agree’ on
            a cryptographically secure algorithm in order to generate rolling
            codes that are used to authenticate the remote.
          </p>

          <p>
            These keys are generated and tracked using a <em>counter</em> which
            has to stay in sync between the remote and the car. This ensures
            that the car doesn’t reuse an old key, and that the remote always
            generates fresh keys.
          </p>

          <p>
            An example of a rolling code implementation is pictured below
            <small
              >(credits:

          <p>
            <img
              src="https://i.0x44.cc/b/rolling-code-explanation.png"
              alt=""
            />
          </p>

          <ul>
            <li><strong>uid</strong>: ID of the car/remote link</li>
            <li>
              <strong>enc<sub>k</sub></strong
              >: Implementation of the rolling code algorithm
            </li>
            <li><strong>ctr</strong>: The car’s counter</li>
            <li><strong>ctr’</strong>: The remote’s counter</li>
          </ul>

          <p>
            The validity window permits the remote to not go out of sync if the
            car doesn’t happen to receive the signal (typically with a max of
            255 out-of-range button presses on most implementations, after which
            the remote has to be manually resynchronized).
          </p>

          <p>Alright, let’s go back to the drawing board.</p>

          <p>
            Since we now know that rolling codes are
            <em>cryptographically</em> secure, it becomes easy for us to spot
            the
            <span style="color: lightgreen">part of the signal</span>
            responsible for this implementation (which would be the one with the
            highest entropy):
          </p>

          <p>
            <img
              src="https://i.0x44.cc/b/urh-rolling-code-spotted.png"
              alt=""
            />
          </p>

          <p>
            We can also make the assumption that the
            <span style="color: deepskyblue">incremental ID</span> we’ve
            identified earlier is the counter for the rolling code system. As it
            also conveniently sits right next to the code.
          </p>

          <p>
            By comparing lock and unlock signals, I was also able to quickly
            spot <span style="color: plum">the byte</span> responsible for the
            command (8 = unlock, 4 = lock):
          </p>

          <p>
            <img
              src="https://i.0x44.cc/b/urh-command-byte-spotted.png"
              alt=""
            />
          </p>

          <p>
            Now all that’s left for us to guess from the signal’s ‘variable
            parts’ are the two <span style="color: red">red changes</span> we
            marked earlier:
          </p>

          <p>
            <strong>1)</strong> For the first one, we notice that the same
            values repeat themselves across the other captured signals.
          </p>

          <p>Converting the 3 values to binary, we notice the following:</p>

          <ul>
            <li>0x6: <strong>01</strong>10</li>
            <li>0xA: <strong>10</strong>10</li>
            <li>0xE: <strong>11</strong>10</li>
          </ul>

          <p>
            Interesting, looks as if it’s packing some sort of sequence number
            for the packets.
          </p>

          <p>And what if we check the final (4th) packet as well?</p>

          <ul>
            <li>0x13: <strong>100</strong>11</li>
          </ul>

          <p>
            Yup, our theory seems to check out
            <small>(ignore the lowest bit that changed here)</small>.
          </p>

          <p><strong>2)</strong> Let’s guess the last byte now.</p>

          <p>
            We can notice that this one not only changes for each packet, but it
            does so completely across all signals as well.
          </p>

          <p>
            Seeing that this is the last byte on the packet and that it changes
            pretty randomly, leads me to suspect this being a checksum.
          </p>

          <p>
            One thing we can try doing is a XOR of this byte with the other byte
            we just analyzed, to see if we can end up with a static value (since
            pretty much <em>everything</em> besides these two bytes actually
            stays <em>static</em> when it comes to the 3 rolling code packets).
          </p>

          <p>Let’s try with these two examples:</p>

          <p>
            <img
              src="https://i.0x44.cc/b/urh-checksum-theory-test.png"
              alt=""
            />
          </p>

          <p>Example 1:</p>

          <ul>
            <li>0x06 ^ 0xB9 = <strong>0xBF</strong></li>
            <li>0x0A ^ 0xB5 = <strong>0xBF</strong></li>
            <li>0x0E ^ 0xB1 = <strong>0xBF</strong></li>
          </ul>

          <p>Example 2:</p>

          <ul>
            <li>0x06 ^ 0xCC = <strong>0xCA</strong></li>
            <li>0x0A ^ 0xC0 = <strong>0xCA</strong></li>
            <li>0x0E ^ 0xC4 = <strong>0xCA</strong></li>
          </ul>

          <p>Bingo. This is definitely a XOR checksum.</p>

          <p>
            By applying XOR on all the bytes of the packets, we notice that the
            value always ends up being off by 1:
          </p>

          <p><img src="https://i.0x44.cc/b/urh-bad-checksum.png" alt="" /></p>

          <p>
            This leads us to conclude that the first 2 bytes of the packet are
            likely excluded from the checksum (which is where the 1 is coming
            from):
          </p>

          <p>
            <img
              src="https://i.0x44.cc/b/urh-synchronization-bytes.png"
              alt=""
            />
          </p>

          <p>
            And this actually makes sense, since these bytes would act here as a
            <a
              href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Syncword"
              rel="noopener noreferrer"
              target="_blank"
              >syncword</a
            >
            to synchronize the receiver and indicate the beginning of the data.
          </p>

          <p>
            <strong>Note:</strong> If you’re wondering about the utility of the
            initial <span style="color: yellow">long burst</span> highlighted in
            yellow in the captures - that one serves to basically wake up the
            radio receiver and prepare it to start receiving data (since it goes
            in an idle low power state on inactivity). And if you’re also
            wondering why the remote sends 3 packets with roughly the same data,
            it’s simply to insure some sort of reliability. In case one of the
            packets gets corrupted on the way (which we saw happen on an earlier
            screenshot).
          </p>

          <h4 id="final-result">Final result</h4>

          <p>
            After labeling the rest of the bytes to my best guess, this is the
            result I ended up with:
          </p>

          <p>
            <img src="https://i.0x44.cc/b/urh-final-labelization.png" alt="" />
          </p>

          <p>Neat. We’ve just reverse engineered a car key fob signal.</p>

          <p>
            Tune in next time when I (hopefully) write about how I integrated
            support for this signal format on the Flipper Zero in order to be
            able to read, re-serialize, and replay it.
